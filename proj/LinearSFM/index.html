                        We present a new structure from motion (Sfm) technique based on point and vanishing
                        point (VP) matches in images. First, all global camera rotations are computed from
                        VP matches as well as relative rotation estimates obtained from pairwise image matches.
                        A new multi-staged linear technique is then used to estimate all camera translations
                        and 3D points simultaneously. The proposed method involves first performing pairwise
                        reconstructions, then robustly aligning these in pairs, and finally aligning all
                        of them globally by simultaneously estimating their unknown relative scales and
                        translations. In doing so, measurements inconsistent in three views are efficiently
                        removed.
                        <br><br>
                        Unlike sequential Sfm, the proposed method treats all images equally, is easy to
                        parallelize and does not require intermediate bundle adjustments. There is also
                        a reduction of drift and significant speedups up to tw orders of magnitude over
                        sequential Sfm. We compare our method with a standard Sfm pipeline [1] and
                        demonstrate that our linear estimates are accurate on a variety of datasets, and
                        can serve as good initializations for final bundle adjustment. Because we exploit
                        VPs when available, our approach is particularly well-suited to the reconstruction
                        of man-made scenes.
